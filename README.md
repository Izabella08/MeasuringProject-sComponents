Within this project, a package of classes has been created that contains functions that allow the measurement of the execution time and the number of executions for different components used in a Java program.

The components for which the execution time was calculated are the following:
- Reading from a database;
- Writing in a database;
- Generating a .txt file;
- Generating a .pdf file;
- Reading from a .csv file.

Components for which the execution time was calculated, as well as the number of executions, are the following:
- Fibonacci series;
- Sorting an array using the recursive Selection Sort method;
- Sorting an array using the recursive Bubble Sort method;
- Sorting an array using the recursive Insertion Sort method;
- Sorting an array using the recursive Quick Sort sorting method.
